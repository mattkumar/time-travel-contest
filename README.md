R Studio Table Contest 2022

## About
This is my entry into the [R Studio 2022 Table Contest.](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-table-contest-2022/) It uses Quarto, reactable, countup and scss to style the time travel machine seen in [Back To The Future.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/) </br>

You may view it [here.](https://mattkumar.quarto.pub/time-travel/)

## Aims
My aims for this project were two-fold:

1. To think about creative uses of tables! 

2. Continue to investigate and experiment with reactable, scss and Quarto.

## Features
I attempt to recreate the time machine gizmo by using a variety of scss styling and html elements. Additionally, I aim for a 3D perspective view of the table by giving it "depth". In each case, I use the countup package to simulate the time machine calibrating.

## Assets
The fonts `alarm clock.woff` and `Impact_label.woff` were downloaded from [here.](https://www.cdnfonts.com/).
